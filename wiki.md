**Food deserts** are *geographical zones* that are deprived of **supermarkets, organic foods**, and often contain **fast foods** instead. They are affecting the health and well-being of **millions** of Americans, and they are found mainly in the South.  


## The Issue
The rise of food deserts in America is a major issue. They are directly [linked to obesity](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/5052613), diabetes, and risk of heart attacks for those who live in one(Cereco, 2023). People who live in a food desert automatically have less access to nutritous foods that would benefit their health. [Studies show](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/195543) that taking care of what you eat can have a direct impact on your long-term health and even focus during the day which can impact performance(Hu et. al, 2002).

## What are the solutions?
There are ongoing solutions to resolve the food desert crisis. Farmers markets are an effective way of providing nutritous, organic foods to food desert residents. In addition, mobile farmers markets allows the organizations to come to the neighborhoods and make a direct impact on the community.


## How can you help?
You can also make an impact in these food deserts by contacting your local district representative and asking how food deserts are being mitigated in your area or if you are at risk. Donating to one organization can make a massive impact on someones ability to receive the food they need.
